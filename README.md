The latest version 2.4, presented on this site, includes a lightweight generator of simple building objects for the OpenSCAD modeling environment, which now allows you to view the printed circuit board in 3D.

In Freepcb2.4, a 3D part object is created by extruding a figure from a simple polyline drawn in the part footprint editor, but the polyline must be closed, that is, be a contour. Setting the extrusion parameters is carried out through a dialog box called up from the right-click menu on the selected polyline segment.
